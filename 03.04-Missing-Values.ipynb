Use of a separate mask array requires allocation of an additional Boolean array, which adds overhead in both storage and computation. A sentinel value reduces the range of valid values that can be represented, and may require extra (often nonoptimized) logic in CPU and GPU arithmetic, because common special values like `NaN` are not available for all data types.\n","\n","As in most cases where no universally optimal choice exists, different languages and systems use different conventions.\n","For example, the R language uses reserved bit patterns within each data type as sentinel values indicating missing data, while the SciDB system uses an extra byte attached to every cell to indicate an NA state."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e4qnZGwkMesy"},"source":["## Missing Data in Pandas\n","\n","The way in which Pandas handles missing values is constrained by its reliance on the NumPy package, which does not have a built-in notion of NA values for non-floating-point data types.\n","\n","Perhaps Pandas could have followed R's lead in specifying bit patterns for each individual data type to indicate nullness, but this approach turns out to be rather unwieldy.\n","While R has just 4 main data types, NumPy supports *far* more than this: for example, while R has a single integer type, NumPy supports 14 basic integer types once you account for available bit widths, signedness, and endianness of the encoding.\n","Reserving a specific bit pattern in all available NumPy types would lead to an unwieldy amount of overhead in special-casing various operations for various types, likely even requiring a new fork of the NumPy package. Further, for the smaller data types (such as 8-bit integers), sacrificing a bit to use as a mask would significantly reduce the range of values it can represent.\n","\n","Because of these constraints and trade-offs, Pandas has two \"modes\" of storing and manipulating null values:\n","\n","- The default mode is to use a sentinel-based missing data scheme, with sentinel values `NaN` or `None` depending on the type of the data.\n","- Alternatively, you can opt in to using the nullable data types (dtypes) Pandas provides (discussed later in this chapter), which results in the creation an accompanying mask array to track missing entries. These missing entries are then presented to the user as the special `pd.NA` value.\n","\n","In either case, the data operations and manipulations provided by the Pandas API will handle and propagate those missing entries in a predictable manner. But to develop some intuition into *why* these choices are made, let's dive quickly into the trade-offs inherent in `None`, `NaN`, and `NA`.
